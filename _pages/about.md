Hi. Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/) under the supervision of professor [Jinwook Seo](http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/people/jinwook-seo). 


My research interests include information visualization, interactive data analysis, and human-computer interaction. I am currently working on the development of interactions and a visual analytics system for the analysis of high-dimensional data. 

I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from the Seoul National University in 2021.
