Hi. Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University, under the supervision of Professor [Jinwook Seo](http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/people/jinwook-seo). 


My research interests include information visualization, interactive data analysis, and human-computer interaction. I am currently working on developing interactions and a visual analytics system to analyze high-dimensional data.

I received my B.S. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/) from [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/) in 2021.
